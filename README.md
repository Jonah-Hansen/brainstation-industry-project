____________________________________________________________________

this app was create from scratch in just 20 hours, as a Hackathon style competition. in that time, we wrote around 1600 lines of code to create a basic recreation of the Google Search results page and adding a feature to open a simple accessibility options page, where users can toggle different features to increase usability across a variety of disabilities. 

The primary purpose of this tool is to make accessibility tools **more accessible!**


## if you'd like to run this code yourself, you can execute npm i, then npm start in the root directory.
